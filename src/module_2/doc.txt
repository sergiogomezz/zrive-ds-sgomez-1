explanation about features is left.

1. In almost all regions, the average is 2 orders per user,
which might indicate that we don't have many regular customers.
2. There are predominant regions in terms of the number of orders,
but we cannot draw precise information without first investigating the size of these regions.
3. There are very few entries for family, pets, children, etc., 
which could either indicate that this information was recently added, or that only users who believe 
it will benefit them bother to fill it out. No conclusive information can be drawn from this.
